## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Share Link Analysis**: The app extracts the Google Drive folder ID from the share URL
2. **Public API Access**: Uses Google Drive's public API (no authentication needed)
3. **Database Discovery**: Searches for `MyLibrary.db` in the shared folder
4. **Direct Download**: Downloads the database file directly from Google Drive
5. **Local Setup**: Creates a local library environment with the downloaded data

### Security & Privacy

- **Read-Only Access**: Remote users can only view/download, not modify your files
- **No Account Access**: They cannot see your other Google Drive files
- **Public Folder Only**: Only the specific folder you share is accessible
- **Local Storage**: Database is downloaded and stored locally on their machine

### Network Requirements

- **Initial Setup**: Internet required to download database (~10-50MB typical)
- **Ongoing Use**: Works completely offline after setup
- **Updates**: User would need new share link if you update the database

## Advanced Options

### Multiple Database Versions

If you have multiple versions:
```
üìÅ Shared Folder/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MyLibrary.db (current version)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MyLibrary_backup.db (backup)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MyLibrary_v2.db (newer version)
```

The app will automatically use `MyLibrary.db` first, or the first `.db` file found.

### Custom Folder Structure

The app searches for any `.db` file in the shared folder, so you can organize however you prefer:
```
üìÅ Educational Library/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Database/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MyLibrary.db
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Documentation/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.txt
```

### Updating the Database

When you update your database:
1. **Replace** `MyLibrary.db` in the shared folder
2. **Remote users** can re-run setup to get the latest version
3. **No new share link needed** - same link works
