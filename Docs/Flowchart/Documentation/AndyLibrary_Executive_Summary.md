## 🔄 **User Journey Overview**

**Complete Flow:** Visit → Register → Verify Email → Login → Setup Google Drive → Access Books

**Time Investment:**

- Initial Setup: 15-45 minutes
- Return Visits: 30 seconds

**Key Dependencies:**

- Email verification (Gmail SMTP)
- Google Drive OAuth integration
- Manual folder/file management

---

## 🚨 **Critical Issues Identified**

### **1. Email Verification Bottleneck (HIGH RISK)**

- **Issue:** 25% of users never verify due to spam filters/SMTP issues
- **Impact:** Complete registration failure
- **Solution:** Backup SMTP providers + manual verification option

### **2. Google Drive Complexity (HIGH RISK)**

- **Issue:** 40% abandon at OAuth + manual folder setup required
- **Impact:** No book access possible
- **Solution:** Auto-create folders + better pre-OAuth education

### **3. Account Security Over-Protection (MEDIUM RISK)**

- **Issue:** 15-minute lockout after 5 failed attempts
- **Impact:** Legitimate user frustration
- **Solution:** Progressive lockout + CAPTCHA integration

### **4. File Management Complexity (MEDIUM RISK)**

- **Issue:** Exact filename matching required for book access
- **Impact:** User confusion and failed book access
- **Solution:** Fuzzy matching algorithm + filename suggestions
