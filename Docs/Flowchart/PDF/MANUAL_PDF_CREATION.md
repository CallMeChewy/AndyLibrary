# Manual PDF Creation Instructions

Since automated browser PDF generation may not work on all systems, 
here's how to create the visual flowchart PDF manually:

## Method 1: Chrome/Chromium (Recommended)

1. Open Chrome or Chromium browser
2. Navigate to: file:///home/herb/Desktop/AndyLibrary/Docs/Flowchart/HTML/AndyLibrary_Fixed_Registration_Process.html
3. Wait for the flowchart to fully render (2-3 seconds)
4. Press Ctrl+P (Print)
5. Choose "Save as PDF" as destination
6. Set layout to "Landscape" for better fit
7. Click "More settings"
8. Enable "Background graphics" 
9. Set margins to "Minimum"
10. Save as: AndyLibrary_Visual_Flowchart.pdf

## Method 2: Firefox

1. Open Firefox browser
2. Navigate to the same HTML file
3. Press Ctrl+P (Print)
4. Choose "Save to PDF"
5. Set orientation to "Landscape"
6. Save the PDF

## Method 3: Edge/Safari

Similar process - Print > Save as PDF with landscape orientation

## Why This Works Better:

- ✅ Captures the actual visual flowchart with all colors and shapes
- ✅ Includes all interactive elements as they appear
- ✅ Perfect text rendering with no visibility issues
- ✅ Proper layout and scaling
- ✅ All browsers handle Mermaid rendering correctly

The resulting PDF will have:

- Full visual flowchart with proper shapes and colors
- All text clearly visible
- Professional layout suitable for presentations
- Built-in PDF viewer zoom/navigation capabilities
