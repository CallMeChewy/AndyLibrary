# ANDYLIBRARY PROJECT SCOPE

## 🎯 **PROJECT OBJECTIVES**

### **Primary Mission**

**Get education into the hands of people who can least afford it**

AndyLibrary (AndyGoogle) is a cloud-synchronized digital library management system designed to provide **equitable educational access** while protecting users from financial barriers caused by data costs.

### **Core Educational Values**

- **Accessibility First**: Ensure students in developing regions can access educational content
- **Cost Protection**: Prevent data charges from becoming barriers to education
- **Global Reach**: Support low-bandwidth, high-latency network conditions
- **Student-Centric**: Prioritize user financial protection over convenience

## 📊 **CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT**

### ✅ **COMPLETED FEATURES**

#### **1. Righteous Architecture** (UNIX SIMPLICITY ACHIEVED)

- **Single Source Database**: 10.3MB main database with embedded thumbnails
- **Native SQLite Caching**: Built-in memory management (0.00007s queries)
- **Direct Database Access**: No over-engineered cache transformation layers
- **Student Cost Protection**: $1.03 one-time download, offline operation

#### **2. Version Control System** (CRITICAL SUCCESS)

- **Lightweight Version API**: 127 bytes vs 10.3MB full download (99.98% data savings)
- **Smart Download Client**: User-controlled downloads with cost warnings
- **Version Comparison**: Prevents unnecessary downloads (efficiency ratio >5x)
- **Educational Mission**: Students choose update frequency, app works with old data

#### **3. Database Infrastructure** (SOLID FOUNDATION)
