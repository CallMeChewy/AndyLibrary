ok, i have looked at the downloaded db and the cached version. these are questions to expand my knowledge of nest proactces, not suggestions for changes.
i cannot think of a use case where the dropdown data would not occur without displaying the associated books in the grid. the grid requires the thumbnail and author at least. is the method you use save much time if the main db has to be accessed too? i wondered how you got the cache so small. is 10-50 mb of cache unreasonable for most users? should there be options. can there be options. most $50 tablets seem capable with or without cache. most usage will not be from a server, more likely personal mobile or laptop. single user mode. we want to make sure this app is available for everyone, but we don't want to hamper the other 75% with resonably current inexpensive devices.
