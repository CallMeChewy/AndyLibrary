2. **Educational mission** drives better technology than pure commercial interests  
3. **Student-first design** creates more impactful systems than admin-convenience
4. **Experience matters** - 50+ years of engineering wisdom guides better decisions
5. **Simple architecture** serves users better than over-engineered complexity

### **Global Impact Vision**

**Year 1**: 10,000 students accessing quality educational content
**Year 3**: 100,000 students across 25 countries  
**Year 5**: 1,000,000 students - true global educational equity

**The ripple effects**:
- Students in developing regions access quality education
- Teachers have curated, reliable educational resources
- Educational costs decrease globally
- AI-human collaboration model spreads to other domains
